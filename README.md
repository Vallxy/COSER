## Abstract

Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is one of the primary approaches for testing mobile apps. Test scripts serve as the main carrier of GUI testing, yet they are prone to obsolescence when the GUIs change with the apps' evolution. Existing repair approaches based on GUI layouts or images prove effective when the GUI changes between the base and updated versions are minor, however, they may struggle with substantial changes. In this paper, a novel approach named COSER is introduced as a solution to repairing broken scripts, which is capable of addressing larger GUI changes compared to existing methods. COSER incorporates both external semantic information from the GUI elements and internal semantic information from the source code to provide a unique and comprehensive solution. The efficacy of COSER was demonstrated through experiments conducted on 20 Android apps, resulting in superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art tools METER and GUIDER. In addition, a tool that implements the COSER approach is available for practical use and future research.
